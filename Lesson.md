# Lesson 0: Introduction

Java is a popular programming language that has been used to build mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games, and much more. We even use it to code robots.

This guide will help setup your computer to run Java and also explain how to follow through this course.

## Setup

1. Open a browser and head to [Github](https://github.com/). Please `Sign Up` or `Sign In` and then `Login` to your account.

2. Now open the [Repository](https://github.com/EnergyTechChargers5298/JavaZeroToHero). For now think of a repository as a place where our code is stored.

3. Click on the green button called `Code` then click on the `Codespaces` tab that appears. We can click on the button called `Create codespace on Java-0`. This should bring you to a new window.

4. Next we go to `Extensions Tab` on the left which is indicated by the 4 cubes. Then search for `Extension Pack for Java` and `Install the First Extension` listed.

5. Now we should be able to run the test code. Click on the `Welcome.java` file. On the top right a `Run` button should appear which we can use to run the code. Click the `green button` for any dialogs that appear. On the bottom window called the `terminal` a `Hello World!` should appear. This verifies that the setup worked.

6. In the `Welcome.java` file, try replacing `World` in `"Hello World!"` with your name and save it with `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`. Now run it!

7. Once you have completed a lesson, you can click on the `Source Control Icon` which has three circles connected by two lines. `Write a message` stating you completed the lesson then click the green button that says `Commit`. A dialog should appear where you click on the `Green Button`. Now that this is done, we can go to the next lesson!

8. To go to the next lesson, click on the `Source Control Icon` and then click on the `Three Dots`. Click `Checkout to...` then select `Java-1`. This should bring you to lesson 1. To verify that your lesson is most up to date click on the `Three Dots` again then click `Pull`.

## Java: Zero to Hero

The goal of `Java: Zero to Hero` is to learn the basics of programming in Java. Each lesson has a `Lesson.md` file that teaches everything for that section. There is also a `Playground.java` file which we recommend you use to code along while following the lesson. Go through the lesson completely before moving on to practice.

Practicing is the most valuable tool when it comes to learning how to code. Each lesson has a folder called `Practice` where each file refers to a different problem. Do not change the name of those files. 

Remember to read the problem carefully and look at all the notes in the file before starting. Also look back at the `lesson.md` and don't be afraid to seek help when you need it. Google is also a valuable resource for answering your questions.

Finally, a lesson is complete when all the practice problems are done completely. To verify that they are correct, run `Test.java`. This will print out to the `terminal` with detailed information about what problems are done correctly and what aren't. Once it states everything is done, you are ready to move on to the next lesson!
